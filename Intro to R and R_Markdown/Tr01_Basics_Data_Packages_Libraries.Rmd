## Level: Beginner

  Goals: 
    1) Introduce the basics of working directories, libraries, functions, 
    2) Introduce the basics of data objects and importing & managing data sets 
    3) Understanding the basic structure of data sets 
    4) Introduction to R Markdown files 

## Setting Up a Working Directory
A working directory in R is a file location on your computer: 
  The working directory is the location on your computer R will use for reading     and writing files. Use `getwd()` to print your current working directory to    the console. Use `setwd()` to set your working directory.

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/IDELTORO/OneDrive - Ramboll/Desktop/R/Training Scripts")

```

## Loading Libraries 
  * Libraries are a collection of functions 
  * A function is a set of statements (code) organized together to perform a specific task


```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library (tidyverse)
```


![The Tidyverse](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R/img/tidyverse_website.png)
 
Tidyverse is a "metapackage" with many packages nested in it. By loading a single meta package (i.e. "tidyverse" ) you now have access to the functions in all associated packages (e.g. "dplyr" or "ggplot")


## Loading & understanding a dataset 
```{r}
#preloaded datasets in R 
data (iris)
str (iris)
#preloaded datasets automatically generate an object. In this case the "iris" object 

#load your own datasets into r (.csv format) 
# When you load in a dataset from your
#?read.csv ()


```
## Keep your data tidy:
