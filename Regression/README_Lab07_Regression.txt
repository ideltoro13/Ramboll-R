README_Lab07_Regression:
This lab uses two datasets, one on estimating lion age based on the proportion of black on their noses and the second on the behavior of boobies in an experiment. Chunks 1 and 2 load the data and set up the basic hypotheses of regression to be tested. Chunk 3 investigates data normality assumptions using density and qq plots. 
In chunk 4 and 5 students build the scatter plots and apply the best fit linear regression. The regression stats are calculated in lab 5 using the “lm” function. While chunk 6 investigates the residuals of the best fit line.
