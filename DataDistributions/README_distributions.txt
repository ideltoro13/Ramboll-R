README: Lab 03- Distributions 
The objectives of this las is to introduce students to generating the standard normal distribution and plotting distributions in alternative ways (histograms vs. density plots) using the tidyverse. There is also a basic introduction to data wrangling. Students will work with the “sleep” dataset. The materials presented in the worksheet are also included in the blank student template RMD file. 

Statistically, students will test for normality using the Shapiro test. We require a supporting package (e1071) to test for kurtosis and skewness of distributions. In the final chunk students explore alternative arguments to augment their plots in ggplot2.
